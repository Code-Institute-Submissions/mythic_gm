          <h3 id="ttrpg">What is a roleplaying game?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Tabletop Role-playing games (ttrpg) such as Dungeons & Dragons and Call
             of Cthulhu are pen & paper, collaborative storytelling games. They use dice to determine results.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In most roleplaying games, there are two distinct roles. There is the Game Master(GM) and the players.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The GM is the storyteller for the game. They create and describe the adventure for the players, 
            introduce conflicts, control any characters the players interact with(NPC's), give the players goals to accomplish, 
            and describe the outcomes of dice rolls.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The players each control one character that they can create themselves. They work together to 
            overcome any conflicts and plotlines introduced by the GM. They do this by describing what they 
            want to do and rolling dice to see if they were successful or not. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In most games, player actions are limited to the choices given to them by the game's designer. Role-playing games are different 
            in that the players have complete control over where they want to go and what they want to do.

          <h3 id="how-to-use">Mythic</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Mythic is a tool for use with your table-top RPG sessions. It is a simple GM emulator. You can ask Mythic yes/no questions and generate random events that focus 
            on relevant NPC and story threads in your adventure. It is a digital implementation of 
            the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator" target="_blank">Mythic Game Master Emulator</a> book.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Before a session begins, the GM must spend a lot of time generating the adventure, coming up with plot points, characters, and obstacles.
            Mythic is different in that it requires no preparation from the GM. Mythic adventures are improvised, with perhaps a few 
            minutes of brainstorming to form the initial setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mythic can also be played entirely without a GM. The mechanics in 
            Mythic that allow a GM to run an adventure without preparation, also allow groups of players to play without a GM.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The possibilities of what mythic can generate are limited only by the player's imagination. At times answers will be clear, 
            and at other times they will be vague and require a good bit of interpretation.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            If you don't know anything about role-playing games, that's ok. Mythic 
            can be used as a creative writing tool to generate ideas for stories, characters, and plot twists. 
          </p>

          <br>
          <h3 id="rules">How to use Mythic</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Setup</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            To get the most out of Mythic it's best to do a couple of minutes of preparation. Or you can skip the setup and start playing straight away.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Go to the "lists" tab and add any characters or threads relevant to your adventure. If you have no ideas, you can generate an event in the oracle tab or go
             <a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/" target="_blank">to this website</a>  A thread is just a plot point the characters are moving towards. There is no minimum or 
             maximum amount of characters or threads in a session.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Go to the "scene" tab and add your first scene. Label it whatever you would like, then write the scene setup. A couple of lines is fine. 
            All that is important is that you write the main action you would like to accomplish for this scene. 
            If you have no ideas, again, you can generate an event in the "oracle" tab and see what ideas it gives you. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Starting a new scene</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            When ready to begin a scene, in the "oracle" tab click the "start scene" button. This will tell you if 
            your scene is unmodified, altered, or interrupted. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            An unmodified scene proceeds as you had planned.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            An altered scene is changed slightly. Perhaps it's the weather or you take a detour somewhere, but the main action of the scene is the same. 
            You can generate an event if you need an idea of how.
          <br>
          <p>
            An interrupted scene is completely different than what you had planned. An interrupted scene will also give you a focus for the interruption. 
            The "event" button will generate the context of the interruption. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Playing out a scene</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            A scene is of no fixed length. It ends when you feel it has ended. If the main action of the scene is 
            finished, consider the scene over. A scene can last 5 minutes or 5 days, it doesn't matter.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            When you feel the scene is over you can end it. If the players felt in control of the scene, 
            lower the chaos number. If the players were not in control, then raise the chaos number. If in doubt, raise it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Go to the list tab and update and characters or threads. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Go to the scene tab and create a new scene. Repeat the process as much as you like. There is no minimum or maximum scenes in a session.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Asking questions</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            At various points throughout the session, players may want to ask questions, "Is a door locked?", 
            "Is there any light coming from the house?". In these situations, players can use the question button in the oracle tab.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Form a yes/no question in your mind. when you click the question button, set the odds of a "YES" answer to the question and click the submit button.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There are four possible results. Yes, no, yes exceptional, and no exceptional.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Along with the answer to the question, a random event may also trigger. 
            The players will receive a focus and should generate an "event" for the context.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Some Example Question</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            “My character parachutes out of the plane. He tries to land in an open field. Does he make it safely?”
          </p>
          <p>Yes: Yep.</p>
          <p>No: He lands in the field, but hurts himself.</p>
          <p>Exceptional Yes: He lands without a problem, and very quickly</p>
          <p>Exceptional No: He misses the field entirely and crashes into the forest. He hurts himself, badly.</p>
          <br>
          <p>“As I walk through the dark hall, I listen carefully. Do I hear any sounds?”</p>
          <p>Yes: You hear something, but you don’t know what yet.</p>
          <p>No: All is silent.</p>
          <p>Exceptional Yes: You hear something very loud, perhaps very sudden. It may take another question to figure out what it is.</p>
          <p>Exceptional No: All is silent. There is no appropriate exceptional result, so this remains the same as a simple no</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3 id="other-systems">Mythic & other RPG systems</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Mythic provides structure and ideas for your adventure to unfold naturally, but what about rules for fighting or skill checks?
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Each gaming system will have its own rules for combat, for chases, for using skills. If you get caught in a confrontation playing a game 
            of Dungeons and Dragons, then use these rules for resolving the combat.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            You can also just use Mythic to resolve these confrontations by asking questions. 
            "I punch the zombie. Does it die?" set realistic odds for your character and see what happens.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>NPC = Non Player Character - Any character that the players do not control.</p>
          <br>
          <p>PC = Player Character - Any characters controlled by players.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Remote Event</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Something important has happened that bears on the adventure, but the player characters were not present when the event occurred, they only learn about it remotely. This
            can result in many ways, from a non-player character telling them some piece of news, to coming across evidence of this other event.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>NPC Action</h4>
          <p>
            An existing non-player character makes a surprise action.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>introduce a new PC</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            A brand new face is involved in the adventure. This may be someone the player characters had expected to meet, or a surprise.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Move towards a thread</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Threads are the goals that player characters are going after. These are the unresolved missions that the players are trying to solve. There could be more than one thread in an
            adventure, some big and important while others of less consequence. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Move away from a thread</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Just as the previous random event will help player characters solve an open thread, this random event will make it harder. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Close a thread</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            The random event is so important it actually closes an open thread. To close a thread, the issue is resolved or simply goes away out of the PC's minds.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>PC/NPC negative/positive</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Something bad, or good, happens to a player character, or non player character. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Ambiguous event</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            This is a catchall category for anything that does not directly impact characters or NPCs. The event is not necessarily bad or good. The event can be important, but often it is more 
            atmospheric to the scene.
